write down systematic tests/experiements to implement 

experimental set - up

Inputs:
filename
largest subproblem limit
Lagrangian Multipliers


Outputs: 

Lower Bound plot
size of problem before - size of largest subproblem
number of constraints before - number of constraints relaxed
range of initial duals
range of final duals


Size of original Problem:
Size of largest subproblem:
Number of Constraints in original problem:
Number of Constraints relaxed:
Range of Initial Duals: xxx - xxx
Range of Final Duals: xxx - xxx
include size of largest subproblem and number of constraints relaxed in each LB tracking...


finish making changes to mip model constraints in decompmip
Need to run cplex to get optimal decomposition for 30,40,50 % of the max subproblem. 
Test output vector to see if it results in largest subproblem of 100 variables.
get lower bounds sorted...
